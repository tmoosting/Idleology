  eventText: "Now you may have noticed that the hire cost for these workers is going
    up. You see, workers have this pesky tendency to unionize. The more of them there
    are, the better wages they are able to negotiate. Maybe we can fix that in the
    future, but for now it\u2019s best to just deal with it. As long as there\u2019s
    a net positive cash flow at the end of the day, all is well in the world."
